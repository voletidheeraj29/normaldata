squashing
git rebase -i HEAD~3


The easiest way would be to find the head commit of the branch as 
it was immediately before the rebase started in the reflog...

git reflog


git reset --hard "HEAD@{5}"


You can check the history of the candidate old head by just doing a 
git log HEAD@{5} (Windows: git log "HEAD@{5}").
